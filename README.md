Interactive Excel Dashboard: Pizza Sales

The dataset for Pizza sales was dowloaded from the following links: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?pageSize=10&search=pizza
# DESCRIPTION
A year's worth of sales from a fake pizza restaurant, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, as well as extra information on the type, size, amount, pricing, and ingredients. The dataset came with different excel sheets: orders, order_details, pizzas, pizza_types

# QUESTIONS SOLVED IN OUR ANALYSIS
Are there any peak hours?

Do we have any bestsellers?

How much money did we make this year? 

Can we indentify any seasonality in the sales?

# ANALYSIS TOOLS USED
To be able to create the dashboard we came to use the function Vlookup. 

Creation of many Pivot tables

Usage of Pivot Charts, slicers and Timeline
